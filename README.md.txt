# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

Needed to refactor code to improve search engine optimization. Increased the accessibility of the page by adding alt attributes to images, 
improving the title, and making sure all links are working correctly. Also improved the legibility of the HTML and CSS code by consolidating
elements and tags together and added comments before elements in the code. Any future changes will be easier now that you can change multiple similar
elements all at once. Learned how to refactor code, make comments, and analyze already existing code.
